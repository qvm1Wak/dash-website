HashChain Technology has announced that it acquired technology company NODE40 in order to diversify its cryptocurrency mining strategy with blockchain

31 January 2018   2402

NODE40 Balance is a robust cryptocurrency reporting software that integrates directly with certain major cryptocurrency exchanges, and NODE40 also provides Dash masternode hosting services. The company's aim is to free cryptocurrency investors from the technical hurdles and time investment needed to run Dash masternodes.

NODE 40 was recentry acquired by HashChain, a blockchain technology company, and the publicly traded Canadian cryptocurrency mining company which supports flexible mining operations across major cryptocurrencies.

Patrick Gray, the founder of HashChain stated that one of the major goals of the industry at the moment is cryptocurrency accounting and reporting for tax purposes, that is why software developed by NODE40 is on such a high demand.

> Cryptocurrency mining remains an important focus for HashChain, as we continue to acquire more Rigs and generate revenue on a large scale. The acquisition of the NODE40 Business is an important next step of creating a global blockchain technology company.\
